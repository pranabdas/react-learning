# React getting started 

For local development, make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) in your
computer. You can check whether you have node installed by following command in
the terminal: 
```
node -v 
npm -v
```
They will print the version numbers corresponding to node and npm (node package
manager). 

We can create an empty React app by issuing:
```
npx create-react-app my-react-app
cd my-react-app
```

Note that `npx` runs create-react-app without installing it.

Start the local development server:
```
npm start
```

You should see the default react app running in <http://localhost:3000>

In this repository I have several tutorials on separate branches.
