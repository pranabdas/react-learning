# React useState

[Go back to main branch](https://github.com/pranabdas/react-learning/tree/main)

Here we will use useState to build a counter. We will change the value with a
function instead of directly setting the value as we have done in previous
examples.

Main app is here: [my-react-app/src/App.jsx](./my-react-app/src/App.jsx)
