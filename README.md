# React useEffect cleanup (window size)

[Go back to main branch](https://github.com/pranabdas/react-learning/tree/main)

Here we will print the current browser width, and we will update that value on
resize using useEffect.

We will also add a cleanup function. It is a good practice to clear up the
eventListeners once we are done with them to optimize browser resources.

Main app is here: [my-react-app/src/App.jsx](./my-react-app/src/App.jsx)
